In this work, the dynamic model of a robot manipulator has been investigated. Two problems have been addressed: numerical inversion of the dynamics and dynamic coefficients identification. The former consists in comparing the effects of classical and modified Denavit-Hartenberg conventions using Newton-Euler algorithm. In particular, we focused on the required computational time. The latter regards the design of some persistently exciting trajectories that allow to identify the dynamic coefficients of the manipulator. In the whole work, we referred to the KUKA LWR IV+ 7R robot manipulator. Simulations in the DIAG Robotics Laboratory have been performed to collect data for the second part.
